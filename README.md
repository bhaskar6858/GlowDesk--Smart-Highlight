# GlowDesk

A lightweight and elegant Windows Forms application that gives you a better way to access your recent files and folders — faster, customizable, and visually organized using colored labels and emojis.

It asks users to select a directory, and give a threshold value (number of recently used files you want), and then you get recently used color coded files lined in the recentBox. With green : most recently used, yellow : used prior to the most recent, red : last recently used. Also our Forms application gives you the privilege to right click and copy path of all recently used files, and double clicking on it gives you the access to the file.

Auto scan feature is also provided, when selected, it scans the directory every 10 seconds, thus giving you updated and real time results.

Why is it better than Windows Task Bar? 
Windows Task Bar never allows you give a custom diretory and track recently used files, also right click and copy path privilege is not provided. No color coding in the task bar as such in our project.
